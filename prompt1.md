There is a startup project in mind along with the following specifications. Any advice is appreciated about:

* Overall idea
* Road-map
* Planning
* Time-line
* Field survey
* Effective use of AI chatbots for development

# Problem-solution fit

Since there are already similar startups, it looks like the problem-solution fit might be fine.

Cost of manufacturing personlized products is reduced to mass production cost.

# Product-market fit

Again, similar startups prove that the product-market fit might be achievable.

# Problem

Cost of personalized jewelry items is much larger than mass production.

** Price: not affordable.

Time-consumption is reduced. Cost is reduced. Reduce risk of refunds.

# Industry

Any consumer product can benefit from this problem-solution fit:

Personalization cost == mass production cost

# Innovation

Innovation is on business model.

# Stake holders

* Customer
* Sale channel: retail
* Manufacturers + tech

2nd model: widget

# Solution

The solution is to provide a platform for:

* Customers:
   * To personalize or customize 2D or 2.5D jewelry designs by a user-friendly tool
   * To place orders
   * Easy, fast, low-cost, low-risk.
   * Tech side AR**
* Jewelry workshop:
   * To receive customized designs of 2D or 2.5D jewelry orders
   * To manage the orders in an efficient way
   * To manufacture the orders efficiently by minimal human resources

# Core domain

Looks like the core domain might be the workshop side of the platform. Since the customer side might _not_ be that unclear.

# Business models

There are at least two business models possible:

* Independent.
* Partnership.

## Independent

Retail + tech + manufact. === independent

A complete platform with a customer side and a workshop side along with all the logistics involved.

### Advantages

* High profit margins:
   * Assuming the required human resources may be cut by a factor of 10 or 20 compared to the manual and traditional workflows.
* Protecting competitive advantage by keeping core domain as private.

### Disadvantages

* Being directly involved with the manufacturing.
* Being directly involved with the logistics and shipping.

## Partnership

A complete - or partial? - platform integrated into a partner's website as a widget. The customers won't notice that the widget is developed and managed by us. The customers will perceive the widget as part of the partners website.

### Advantages

* Customer acquisition would be leveraged by the partner.
* Not being directly involved with the manufacturing and the logistics.

### Disadvantages

* Partner might copy our widget internally and abandon our partnership.
* The profit margin is dependent upon the partnership and negotiation.

## Core domain outline

The subject matter experts or SMEs are needed to outline the core domain architecture. The architecture should be able to provide a 10x or 20x efficiency compared to manual and traditional workflows.

## Product innovation

If innovative: workflow doesn't matter
If not innovative: workflow needs optimizations

# Workshop workflow

* Purchase order: `*.ai` adoble illustrator: vector graphics
* Depending upon laser device
   * X,Y min & max
   * Import ai or SVG
   * hashing the surface
   * Generally we have more cut, less engrave
   * 100 micron or 1 millimeter
   * View port == X,Y of laser

Workflow:

   * Categorize by Thickness & metal type
   * Packing 2D: less waste
   * Cut
   * Package
   * Ship
   * ... Finish
   * ... To be able to fine-tune by the human employee
