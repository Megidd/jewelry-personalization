I need a WooCommerce platform with the following specifications. Can you help me with detailed setup instructions along with the WooCommerce source code to bring up such a platform on an Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS server?

Setup instructions should include connecting the WooCommerce platform to a domain name like `facegold.com`.

# UI

## UI input

Through the UI, the user uploads an image.

## UI output

Through the UI, the user receives a 3D model corresponding to the uploaded image. Please:

* Return a sample placeholder 3D model in `*.ply` file format.
* For now, keep the 3D model a sample placeholder:
   * But in the future, sophisticated logic will be run to generate the corresponding 3D model.
* Display a simple preview of the returned 3D model on the UI, if possible.

# Notes

* Please keep CSS code minimal.
* Please keep source code minimal and concise and just straight to the point.
* Whenever possible, please use available libraries rather than developing source code yourself.
* Please try to use NGINX rather than Apache if it's possible.
