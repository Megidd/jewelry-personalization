There was a video call with the team lead 📹 The phase 1 of the roadmap is outlined as follows.

# Roadmap phase 1

## Structure & organization

As both SME and lead, the team lead has already broken down the 1st stage of the roadmap between teams:

* SME and business
* UX team
   * [Reference](https://www.figma.com/design/mzmWIhqWxj80QScjcYMCX1/Personalization-feature?node-id=0-1&t=Q943mGtPFKpNRIeo-1)
* UI team
* Backend team, e-commerce platform
* ...

## Key results & metrics

The key results of roadmap phase 1 can be estimated according to current 2D personalization offerings on the market.

### Current market solutions: manual process

According to national market research, there are at least `2` manufacturers who take the **flat** 2D personalization orders from jewelry shops around the country. They are taking `5` to `10` daily orders from each shop. If they serve around `50` shops daily, the daily orders would be `250` to `500` orders in total.

### Our underestimation: digital platform: automatic process

Based on current manual solutions, the monthly 2D personalization orders on our platform might be roughly underestimated as an average of `100` daily orders. We try to keep our offerings cheap and **affordable**, so let's assume each order generates a revenue of only `$10` dollars. Therefore, the monthly revenue would be expected as:

```
100 == daily orders
$10 == daily revenue per order
100 * $10 * 30 == monthly revenue == $30K
```

The $30K monthly revenue, which looks like a huge underestimation, is still way more than our key result target for roadmap phase 1 which was $5K monthly revenue in `6` months.

```
$30K > $5K
```

The `6x` exceedance maybe indicates strong potential.

## Risk

Since there are already popular solutions on the market with manual workflow, the risk of an automatic platform might be low. But manufacturing capacity constraints might be considered a risk later on.

## Added value

Competitive advantages of an automatic platform over manual workflows might be:

* Faster
* Cheaper
* More convenient
* Higher quality
* Resilient personalization options
* ...

## Focus offerings

Roadmap phase 1 would limit the focus on a few offerings. Roadmap phase 1 will launch the platform with the focused offerings to test the problem-solution fit and product-market fit before phase 2 of the roadmap.

According to market and UX research, the focus is on these types of 2D personalization:

* A **flat** 2D text is added to flat jewelry designs:
   * Manufacturing hardware is available: 2D laser device.
   * Logic code is already implemented by the UI team. It's not a big deal.
* A **curved** 2D text is added to jewelry rings:
   * 3D text will have a curvature to match the ring
   * It's indicated by the attached image 📎
   * Manufacturing hardware is available: SLA 3D print process and metal casting
   * Our team will develop the 3D logic code.

## 3D logic code

The code for adding a **curved** 3D text to a ring is needed 📎 This code is going to be developed by our team:

* Inputs:
   * Text
   * Font
   * Later on: other assets & options
* Assumptions:
   * A predefined simple ring
   * As STL file format, maybe
* Outputs:
   * Ring with **curved** 3D text added to it
   * As STL file format, maybe
   * Estimated weight
