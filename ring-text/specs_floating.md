Is the following problem and solution clear?  If anything is needed, please let me know to provide. Thanks.

# Problem

A 3D ring is created with a 3D text on it. The text characters are floating on air. So, they cannot be manufactured by 3D printing and metal casting. 

Simple ideas are required to elegantly connect the text characters to each other or to the ring itself. To be able to manufacture them by 3D printing and metal casting.

# Solutions

Options are:

* Base Platform Connection (Simplest)
   * A thin platform that connects all letters at their base and merges with the ring
* Decorative Bridges (More Elegant)
   * Stylized connectors between letters
* Organic Flow Connections (Most Artistic)
   * Some flowing connections that look like the text is carved from a single piece
* Ring Extension Tabs (Most Stable)
   * Ring is extended with tabs that support each letter
* Wire/Chain Elements
   * Thin decorative chains or wire-like connections between letters
   * Can add a jewelry-like aesthetic while providing support
* Shadow/Drop Connections
   * Extend each letter downward with a stylized “shadow” that connects to the ring
   * Creates an interesting visual effect while solving the structural issue
* Interlocking Letter Design
   * Modify the font/letterforms so adjacent characters naturally touch or overlap
   * Like cursive writing but in 3D
* Lattice/Web Structure
   * A delicate geometric pattern (honeycomb, spider web, etc.) that connects letters
   * Can be very thin while still providing structural integrity
* Gradient/Fade Connections
   * Letters gradually merge into the ring surface or into each other
   * Creates a “melting” or “emerging” effect
* ...?
   * ... Any other solution option?

## Tips

* For Standing Text:
   * Base platform or decorative bridges - they might look natural and might provide good support.
* For Sleeping Text:
   * Organic flow connections might work best as they can follow the ring’s curve naturally.

## Simplest while the most elegant

Maybe the simplest and the most elegant solution is:

* Connecting each text character to the next character by a wire-like link
* Connecting ring to the first character by a wire-like link
* Connecting ring to the last character by a wire-like link
* The link dimensiones should be such that 3D printing and metal casting would be convenient
