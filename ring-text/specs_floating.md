Is the following problem and solution clear?  If anything is needed, please let me know to provide. Thanks.

# Problem

A 3D ring is created with a 3D text on it. The text characters are floating on air. So, they cannot be manufactured by 3D printing and metal casting. 

Simple ideas are required to elegantly connect the text characters to each other or to the ring itself. To be able to manufacture them by 3D printing and metal casting.

# Solutions

Options are:

* Base Platform Connection (Simplest)
   * A thin platform that connects all letters at their base and merges with the ring
* Decorative Bridges (More Elegant)
   * Stylized connectors between letters
* Organic Flow Connections (Most Artistic)
   * Some flowing connections that look like the text is carved from a single piece
* Ring Extension Tabs (Most Stable)
   * Ring is extended with tabs that support each letter
* ...?
   * ... Any other solution option?

## Tips

* For Standing Text:
   * Base platform or decorative bridges - they look natural and provide good support.
* For Sleeping Text:
   * Organic flow connections might work best as they can follow the ringâ€™s curve naturally.
